The 50th anniversary of one our civilisation's greatest achievements is only days away. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took our first ever steps on a body other than the Earth by stepping onto the Moon's surface in the Sea of Tranquillity on the 21th of July 1969 at 02:56:15 UTC, while Michael Collins remained in Moon orbit overhead.

There are obviously plenty of resources about this monumental event but as it's a major anniversary some new stuff has popped up which I have been enjoying.

Here's what I have come across so far, if you find something else drop us a comment!

[BBC - 8 Days: To the Moon and Back][1]

Documentary with no narration, just real footage and recreated scenes.

[BBC - 13 Minutes to the Moon][2]

Well produced 8 episode podcast presented by Kevin Fong focussing on how the Moon landing was saved.

[Apollo 11 In Realtime][3]

Amazing website recreating the Apollo 11 experience from the cockpit with visualisations, transcriptions and all mission data presented in real-time. A lot of work has gone in to this!

[Apollo 11][4]

Recent film which I've still to watch but has decent ratings. It's in the cinemas in the U.K. and Germany right now.
