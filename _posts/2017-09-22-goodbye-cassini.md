Witnessing a spacecraft burn up after decades of operation is not something that happens 
very often. This week the [Cassini-Huygens][1] mission ended after a very successful 27 year trip to, 
and around, Saturn. It has really opened up this magical planet with many discoveries about
the planet, it's rings and also the many interesting moons.

One of my all-time favourite science videos came from data and images sent to 
earth from the [Huygens][2] lander. Released from Cassini on December 25, 2004 and landing on
Titan January 14, 2005, the video is a sped up 4 hour journey to the surface which also
shows instrumentation and uses audio to indicate motions and instrument operations.

#### Discoveries
A few important discoveries (of many) that Cassini made:

* Seven new moons orbiting Saturn: [Methone][4], [Pallene][5], [Polydeuces][6], [Daphnis][7], [Anthe][8], [Aegaeon][9], [S/2009 S 1][10]

* Water plumes on Enceladus, making it the first moon with an atmosphere and one of the [best places to search for life][11]

* Capturing amazing images of Saturn and Earth too on '[The Day the Earth Smiled][12]'

It just shows what can be done when people and organisations from around the world
collaborate to achieve great things!
