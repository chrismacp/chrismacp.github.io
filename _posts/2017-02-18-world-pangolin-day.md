Recently I noticed that it was World Pangolin Day and with some species of these 
little critters being critically endangered, I thought I'd try and post something 
 about them to help raise awareness.

You can find more about them here:

World Pangolin Day information is also found here:

The 3D print model which I found on thingiverse is amazing! I managed to print it off
with little effort, the designer should be very proud of their work as it works and 
looks really great.
