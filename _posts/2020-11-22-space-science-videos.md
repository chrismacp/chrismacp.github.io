There are so many great space science videos out there so I'm starting a list to remind myself where they are. Some are not available to watch on demand, but they might be available on YouTube.

**If you find your videos on sites like BitChute, please read about where their advertising revenues go, I choose to avoid them due to their knowingly hosting disinformation, offensive, fascist, racist content.**
