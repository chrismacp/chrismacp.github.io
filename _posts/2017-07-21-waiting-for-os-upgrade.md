The first post for music on here. I had some fun while waiting for my OS to upgrade 
last night. Well to be honest, I was going to try and master a previous track I had made,
but decided to upgrade to the latest macOS Sierra (and amazingly it didn't seem to break 
lots of stuff this time, well done guys!) and got the bug for making a new tune while I was
waiting and playing about on a JU-06.

Here is it anyway, unfinished as always :)
