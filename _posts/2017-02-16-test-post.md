#Test Post

This is the first test post in what could quite possibly be a run of many. Be prepared to spend quite a long time reading this for absolutely no gain at all. If you are still reading this then I would suggest you go and purchase a TR909, turn it up very loud with the tempo set to around 151 and gite it a whirl.
