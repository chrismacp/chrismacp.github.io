We bought a house a few years back and I am now trying to tidy it up little by little. One of
the things that has been bugging me for a while was a kitchen cupboard that had a missing shelf
due to a few missing pegs that hold it up.

It occurred to me last week that I could try to 3D print some new pegs and today I finally got 
some time to see if it would work. TLDR: it does. 

Sometimes I get really excited and instantly fire up [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) (amazing 
open-source 3D modelling application), but I've learnt that it's really worthwhile checking the 
web first to see if someone has already put the effort in. Don't re-invent the wheel, is what we'd 
say at work.

So after about 30 seconds of Googling... I found this design:

I already had some clear [T-Glase](http://taulman3d.com/t-glase-features.html) hooked up on my 
printer and it's a pretty solid material so suitable for the job. It's also 100% reclaimable which
is good too. 

Here is the finished result.

And here is the shelf back in the cupboard, on to the next job.
