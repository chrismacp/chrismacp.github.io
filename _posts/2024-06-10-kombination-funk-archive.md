I started a drum and bass/techno event back in 2002 which was an amazingly fun time and a great event in my life. For a long time I had been thinking about creating an archive of the marketing and media that I kept, and after a friend wrote a related post on Facebook this week I decided to build it finally. 

You can check it out here: [Kombination Funk Archive][1]

This project was also a nice re-introduction to some front-end dev work which I've been excited to get back into recently. Although I am not intending to become a FE dev, I enjoy building fullstack apps and it really helps to understand all aspects of building applications when you are leading a team.
