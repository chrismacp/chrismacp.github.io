Last year my wife and I moved from the U.K. to Germany. I used to enjoy watching my fix of sport at home on Sky, with the Permier League the main attraction. So after all the migratory business was over I tried to figure out how to get access over here. You can get Sky here, but they don't show the Premier League games unfortunately so I've spent nights in pubs and tried to find other ways to watch.

The other day I got a great recommendation from someone though. It's called [DAZN][1] and is a website subscription service with not only football but a whole host of sports. Think Sky Sports with no adverts and without the 100's of guff channels. 

Funnily enough, as soon as he mentioned it, I actually started seeing posters in the train stations advertising the service so I thought I'd give it a try as it seemed a more established product than I was imagining. **Also the first month is free!!** 

So I've been using it for about a week now and I really like it. Here's a few list of things I like and improvments I'd like to see:

## Likes
* Fair price of â‚¬9.99 monthly
* No adverts
* Good range of sports
  * Football
  * Rugby Union
  * Motorsport
  * Tennis
  * Darts
  * Boxing
  * American Football
  * Basketball
  * Baseball
  * Ice Hockey
  * MMA
* Straight forward website (similar to Netflix style UI)
* HD streams
* Mobile app works well (tested on my Android - Pixel 3)

## Improvements
Some things I would like, that I can't get right now:
* English commentary for everything (might not be possible due to licencing)
* More details on what can be watched in which language so it's clear
* More user profile settings, like favourite teams/leagues so they are shown to me first

## Football
The selection of football is really good and I think all of the games that were available on SKY or BT Sports are also available here. That includes Premier League, EFL, FA Cup, Champions League, Nations Cup and more including divisions from other countries like Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Japan... 

The only thing I see being a problem for a lot of British people is that you can't watch eveything in English. Premier League games fall in to that category unfortunately :( 

I have watched EFL games and Italian games in English, but an FA Cup game the other day was in German. I haven't figured out everything that is available in English yet but I'm hoping the Champions league game next week will be. For other sports, I've only checked out a British Rugby Union game so far and it was in English.

Anyway to wrap up, I think this service is definitely worth a go and provides what it says on the tin. I think it could turn in to an amazing service if it keeps improving. With a free month it's really easy to test it out too. 

Happy watching :)
