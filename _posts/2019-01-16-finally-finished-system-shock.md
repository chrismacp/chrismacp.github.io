System Shock the game, released in 1994 and much played by a then 14 year old has been cracked...finally.

It's only taken me 25 years to finish it but the deed has been done. 

I remembered this game vividly from when I was that 14 year old. First-person shooters were relatively new and
thin on the ground yet this had puzzles and a dark sci-fi world that sucked you in. Oh and the elevator music. 

I was excited when I saw it on STEAM after all this time and I have thoroughly enjoyed playing it again. I got
hooked on some of the music from level 6 that I made a little track with it.  

As standard with my music, it's not finished and there's an abrubt end, maybe I'll get back to fixing that some time.
