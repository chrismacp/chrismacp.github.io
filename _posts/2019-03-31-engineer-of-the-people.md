There hasn't been much time recently to keep up with my electronics learning. Finding a game that involved learning about the topic seemed like a good way to do this so I had a look on-line. I came across this interesting game '[Engineer of the People][1]' which presents some puzzles in which you have to build some low level electronics.

It's quite old (I think)and the instructions don't work, but there is a video on Youtube where you can see them. It's also pretty difficult unless you know your stuff, which as beginner I don't. I also found some walk-through videos on Youtube too to help me get started and to reference when I get stuck.

Anyway, I think it's great and very useful way of learning how to use things like NPN and PNP transistors to build gates, oscillators, latches and more.

Have a go, or if you know any more apps like this please leave a comment :)
